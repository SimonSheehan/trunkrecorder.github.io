Hopefully this site makes the Docs for Trunk Recorder a little more readable, and findable.

<!--truncate-->

To get started, I just lifted and shifted the docs from the GitHub repo. I want to spend some time going through them though and trying to make them a little easier to read.

Of course, who knows when I will get around to that. I easily get distracted! Pull Request are always welcome though to help improve the docs...
