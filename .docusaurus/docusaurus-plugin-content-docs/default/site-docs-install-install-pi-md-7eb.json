  "description": "Smaller radio systems can be covered using a Raspberry Pi. If you are interested in doing this, you should really get a Pi 4. It maybe possible to get things running on an older Pi, but you often get unexpect behavior and errors. A Pi 4 can handle 3-4 simulatanious recordings. Make sure you have a good power supply. Also pay attention to heat. If the Pi gets too hot, it will slow down. A good case or fan can help keep it going full tilt. You can also just run debian on a NUC or Miniform PC. These commands will work with a vaneilla debian install as well.",
